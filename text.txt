Most of Turkey lies on the Anatolian Plate, which is being forced westwards by
the collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate.
This westward movement is accommodated by two large strike-slip fault zones,
the west-east trending right lateral North Anatolian Fault in the north of 
the country and the SW-NE trending left lateral East Anatolian Fault towards the
outh-east. Movement on these two faults has been responsible for many large and
damaging earthquakes historically. Fuckinghelvetekys.
